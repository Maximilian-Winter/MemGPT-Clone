Beneath the canopy of midnight's veil,
The moon in all her splendor softly sails.
A silver sphere, suspended, pure and bright,
Her gentle glow a soothing, calming light.

The deep blue sea, a mirror still and wide,
Reflects her grace, its tranquil depth concealed.
In twilight's tender hush, where silence reigns,
A dance ensues between the moonlit waves.

The ocean's heart beats with the tides' soft sighs,
A lullaby that echoes through the night.
The moon, a sentinel, her watchful gaze,
Guards secrets whispered in her watery maze.

Her beams of light pierce through the darkened skies,
Gentle ripples on the sea's mirror-like face.
A dance eternal, a tranquil ballet,
The moon and sea, together they display.
