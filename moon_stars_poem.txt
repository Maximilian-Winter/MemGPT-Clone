In the stillness of the night, where shadows dance and play,
Lies a tapestry of dreams, woven in softest gray.
A canvas painted by the hands of time,
The moon and stars, their gentle rhyme.

Beneath a cloak of velvet dark,
The moonbeams twinkle, like a lark.
Dancing upon the quiet sea,
They sing in whispers, silent and free.

A crescent smile, a waning face,
A full round ball or just a trace,
In its journey through the starry sky,
The moon's soft light, a calming lullaby.

Stars, like diamonds scattered far and wide,
Their stories told in constellations, side by side.
Orion, Leo, Cassiopeia's throne,
In this grand theatre of night, they call their own.

Celestial bodies, ageless and bright,
Guiding sailors through the darkest night.
A celestial ballet, a timeless dance,
The moon and stars, in perfect trance.

So when the world is hushed and still,
Look up to the heavens, let your heart be filled.
With wonder, with awe, with dreams untold,
The moon and stars, a tale of beauty, to behold.
